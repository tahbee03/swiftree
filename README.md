## Description
Swiftree is a social media web application designed to organize your posts into trees, breaking away from the traditional 
scrolling mechanism adopted by other social media platforms. With Swiftree, you will be able to view the most recently made posts
from every user and even posts made by specific users. Swiftree also gives you the power to customize your profile so that you can
add a unique touch to your experience.

## Features
### Universal Tree
On the home page of the application, all users will be able to view the most recently made posts from every user. Clicking on a 
tree node will reveal the associated post. Nodes will then be highlighted so that you can distinguish which posts have already
been viewed. You can also rearrange the relative position of the nodes by clicking the center node. Post times can be determined
by their position relative to the center node: newer posts are closer to the center while older posts are farther from the center.

### Custom Profile and Personal Tree
On your profile page, you will be able to modify your settings and manage the posts you have made. The currently available 
settings allow you to do things such as change your profile picture, modify your username, and even delete your account. Your 
Personal Tree has the same functionalities as the Universal Tree, with the additional power to delete specific posts.
